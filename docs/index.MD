# Welcome to ${systemName}

${systemName} is a free cyberpunk role-playing system born out of a need for a system that's modern, accessible, and streamlined.
The system is available on github.  The maintainers respond to pull requests.  There is a community universe that lets you write your own splat material.

## Have Your Cake and Eat it Too

This system is designed with the assumption that both we and you understand that it’s a mechanism for telling a story, having some fun, and spending time with friends.  We’re not going to lecture you on what we think “good” Cyberpunk is.  Obviously, this is our vision, but that doesn’t mean it has to be the only valid one.

We have included a setting and theme for convenience sake.  There is a generally anti-establishment attitude within with respect to the brutally authoritarian outlook that the Corporations embrace, but if we said the only way you could play this game is by fighting that power, we’d be as bad as they were!  If you’re the gamemaster and you don’t like how something plays or sounds, take it out.  Change it.  Make it yours!
