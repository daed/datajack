# Combat

## Determining if you hit
To see if a character hits with a weapon, first declare whether you are making a regular shot or a called shot (as well the location you are aiming for).  Next, roll a test using the corresponding ability and weapon skill.  The base difficulty for this test is 9, and is modified by the rules below.

## Artful dodging
The targeted character can actively attempt to avoid getting hit.  They can do this by rolling dice as a Parry (Strength) test (requires an object held to parry with) or a Dodge (Dexterity) test (requires nearby cover, or to drop to the ground).  Use the outcome of this roll as the base difficulty for the attackers.  If the attacker rolls it or higher, it’s a hit!

## Other bonuses and penalties

|Circumstance  | modifier|
|----------------|----|
|More than 50 feet away|-1 (per 50 ft)
|Less than 20 feet away|+1
|At least 50% of the target is not visible|-1
|Target is in darkness or dim light|-1
|Target is lying prone|-1
|Firing a called shot|-1


## Determining where you hit
To determine what hitbox is damaged, roll 2d6 and compare the chart for your attack type:

**Regular Attack:**

| 2d6 roll |Hitbox location |
|-----|----------------|
|2-3  | Head 
|4    | Left Arm
|5-6 | Left Leg
|7-8 | Torso
|9-10| Right Leg
|11  | Right Arm
|12  | Groin


**Called Shot:**

| 2d6 roll |Hitbox location* |
|-----|----------------|
|10-12  | Head 
|9-12 | Any Arm
|9-12 | Any Leg
|11-12 | Groin

\* If roll doesn’t match the called location, the torso is hit instead.

That location is then hit by the weapon and does whatever damage is listed in the weapons profile, first to whatever armor the targeted character is wearing in that location, and then to the character itself.  Most weapons deal a single point of damage, though certain weapons may do more damage under certain circumstances.
