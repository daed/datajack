#### Skill Tests

The outcome of most actions are driven by skill tests.  Skill tests represent your character attempting to do a non-routine or unrepeatable task as well as routine tasks performed while distracted or under duress.  Using a firearm is a skill test.  Hacking a system is several skill tests,  depending on security and what the objective is.  Driving to the store for a carton of soymilk probably isn’t unless the character doesn’t know how to drive or is being attacked by ninjas (or conditions are somehow otherwise adverse).

When written out, a skill test looks like this:

```Pilot (Dexterity) 10```

This means that the Pilot skill (which is Dexterity based) should be used, and the difficulty of the test is 10.  In order to attempt the test, the player needs to roll 2d6 (two six sided dice), and add them together with their Dexterity attribute and Pilot skill.  If all four of those add up to 10 or more, then they’ve passed the test and succeeded at piloting whatever vehicle they’re trying to operate.  If they fail, then the GM determines the consequences of failure.  This could be as trivial as getting lost and the trip takes longer, or as catastrophic as causing a major accident.  This is up to the GM (and common sense), but generally a lower result should have more dire consequences.  Rolling two 1’s should probably always count as a catastrophic failure, and two 6’s should count as an amazing success, provided that the task was possible to fail or succeed at in the first place.

### Health

#### Hitpoints and Hitboxes

A hitbox is a specific location on a character that can take damage.  Each hitbox has two hitpoints by default.  This may be modified by traits, cybernetics, body armor or other characteristics.  The hitboxes present on a normal unmodified human are as below.  The overwhelming majority of all characters will have these, but cybernetics, injuries, or other events may add or remove hitboxes as well to a character's list.

|Hitboxes|
|------- |
|Head    |
|Right arm|
|Left arm |
|Torso    |
|Groin    |
|Right leg|
|Left leg |


At one hitpoint remaining, a hitbox is considered injured.  It may continue to be used, but any test depending on it (GM discretion) only receives half of the modifier from skills or traits, rounded down (unless otherwise specified).  A resist pain test may be attempted before a skill test (at the same difficulty) in order to receive the full bonus.

**SPECIAL:**  When a character has more than two injuries, they are at risk of bleeding out.

At zero hit points remaining, a hitbox is too hurt to use properly.  All skill tests requiring the use of this hitbox (GM discretion) will fail.  Due to extreme pain, ANY test performed by the character only receives half of the modifier from skills or traits, rounded down (unless otherwise specified).  A resist pain test may be attempted before a skill test (at the same difficulty) in order to receive the full bonus.  In addition, the character is at risk of bleeding out.

**SPECIAL:** A head, torso, or groin at zero hit points requires the character to pass a Blackout (Fortitude) 12 test every minute to stay conscious.  (A character with a hitbox at negative hitpoints doesn’t need to make this test because they will make one per the rules below)

**SPECIAL:** groin at zero hit points increases the difficulty of the Blackout test by 1.  This permanent injury may also inflict severe trauma not reflected here.

At -1 hit points remaining, a hitbox is destroyed or mangled beyond triage.  This injury cannot be treated outside of a medical center or other comparable facility staffed by competent personnel.  All skill tests requiring the use of this hitbox fail.  Due to extreme pain, ANY test performed by the character only receives half of the modifier from skills or traits, rounded down (unless otherwise specified).  No resist pain test may be attempted to mitigate this penalty.

In addition, the character is at risk of bleeding out and must also pass a ```Blackout (Fortitude)``` test (difficulty = 10 + total missing hitpoints) every minute to stay conscious.  Only one such test must be performed each minute.

**SPECIAL:** A torso or head at negative hit points results in death of that character.

**SPECIAL:** A groin at negative hit points increases the difficulty of the Blackout test by 3.  This permanent injury may also inflict severe trauma not reflected here.

#### Bleeding Out

A character with at least two points of damage is at risk of bleeding out.  Each turn they must make an Endurance (Fortitude) 7 test to keep from bleeding out.  Keep track of how many rounds elapse, and increase the difficulty of this check by one each round.  A failure results in another point of damage done to one of the hitboxes (player’s choice).

The player may (if conscious) ignore bleeding out for a round by taking no other strenuous action other than walking. This represents the character taking time to apply direct pressure to wounds to slow the bleeding.  Each round spent avoiding bleeding in this way doesn’t increase the difficulty of the Endurance test above.

The wounded character (or a helpful passerby) may apply first aid to stop the bleeding.  If this is done then the character is not at risk for bleeding out any more until they take another point of damage.  See the Healing skill description for more information.

### Character Creation

### Character Options

#### Verve
Every character gets 2 Verve at character creation.  This represents a reservoir of supernatural luck, spontaneous reality alignment, a previously unrevealed contingency, or some other je ne sais quoi that they can leverage in the most dire moments to turn the tide.  By spending one, the player can select one of the following effects to apply to the game:

Reroll one or both dice in a skill test the player’s character just failed
Force an npc to reroll both dice in a skill test the npc just attempted (pass or fail)
Delay a source of death for one round (automatic if the player’s character is about to die)

Unless otherwise stated, only one Verve may be spent per player per game session.  The only regular exception to this is when spending Verve to delay death; this is done automatically and only stops when the character runs out of Verve or is resuscitated by another character.

Verve is a powerful and useful means of injecting a twist into the game.  It should not be used lightly, and the player and GM should work together to develop a reason this surprise outcome occurred.  Additional Verve may be awarded by a GM for achieving major milestones, good role-playing, or other reasons, though a character should never have more than 2 Verve total at any time.

#### Traits

Players acquire traits that are modifiers on the character that represent physical changes, social obligations, or karmic fluctuations.  Traits can be bought (during character creation or advancement) or earned.  Some traits provide bonuses or alter abilities.  Not all traits are positive though, and they include negative qualities such as missing limbs or other lingering malalignments.  You may select a positive quality at character start.

#### Positive Traits

#### Negative Traits
